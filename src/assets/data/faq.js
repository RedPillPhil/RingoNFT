In the near future, these unique creatures will allow their owners to stake and farm $ringo tokens, which will be the native currency of an upcoming NFT exchange on the Ring and Crab networks. Additionally, by combining two different Ringos, users will be able to create brand new 'baby' Ringos. These features make Ringos much more than just a digital accessory, but a valuable asset with various exciting possibilities.",
